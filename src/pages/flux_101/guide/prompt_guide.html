<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This guide will help you maximise the benefits of FLUX.1, an AI tool
for creating high-quality images. Whether you’re new to AI image
generation or have some experience, this guide will walk you through the
basics of crafting effective prompts. You’ll learn how to create images
that are visually stunning, detailed, and aligned with your vision.</p>
<p><strong>Note on Model Variability</strong>:</p>
<p>FLUX.1 is a versatile tool, but it’s important to remember that
different FLUX models (e.g., FLUX.1 [<strong>pro</strong>],
[<strong>dev</strong>], [<strong>schnell</strong>]) may produce varying
results from the same prompt. Additionally, factors such as LoRAs
(Low-Rank Adaptations) and other variables can also influence the
output. Experimentation is key to understanding how your chosen model
interprets prompts, so don’t be afraid to tweak and refine your approach
based on the results you get.</p>
<h3 id="variants">Variants</h3>
<p>FLUX.1 is available in three main variants:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>FLUX.1 [pro]</strong>: The flagship model, offering
state-of-the-art performance in image generation. It excels in prompt
following, visual quality, image detail, and output diversity. This
version is ideal for professional use and high-end applications.</li>
<li><strong>FLUX.1 [dev]</strong>: An open-weight, guidance-distilled
model designed for non-commercial applications. It offers similar
quality to the Pro version but with improved efficiency, making it
suitable for developers and researchers.</li>
<li><strong>FLUX.1 [schnell]</strong>: The fastest model in the suite,
optimised for local development and personal use. It’s openly available
under an Apache 2.0 license, making it accessible for a wide range of
users.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="configuration-settings">Configuration Settings</h3>
<p>While a well-crafted prompt is essential, optimising <strong>FLUX.1
[dev]</strong>’s settings is equally important to be able to achieve
high-quality results.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of key configuration parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seed Value</strong>: The seed value ensures consistency in
generated images. A random, but fixed value can be reused to replicate
specific outputs. In this guide, we use a seed value of 42.</li>
<li><strong>Image Dimensions</strong>: Set dimensions, such as
<strong>1024</strong> x <strong>1024</strong> pixels, for optimal image
quality and file size.</li>
<li><strong>Guidance Scale</strong>: A guidance scale of
<strong>3.5</strong> strikes a balance between creativity and adherence
to prompt specificity.</li>
<li><strong>Inference Steps</strong>: Setting <strong>50</strong>
inference steps ensures detailed images, with the model given enough
iterations to fine-tune the visual output.</li>
<li><strong>Number of Images</strong>: Start with a single image
generation (Num Images = 1) to iterate efficiently. These settings allow
<strong>FLUX.1 [dev]</strong> to maintain focus on your prompt’s
specific elements while also delivering creative outputs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="descriptive-language">Descriptive Language</h2>
<h3 id="precision-and-clarity">Precision and Clarity</h3>
<p>FLUX.1 responds best to precise and explicit language. Vague terms
like “<em>nice</em>” or “<em>beautiful</em>” can lead to ambiguous
results. Instead, use specific descriptors that clearly define the image
you want to create.</p>
<p>Precision helps FLUX.1 understand your intent, reducing the
likelihood of unexpected or off-target results.</p>
<p>Focus on details such as colours, textures, styles, and specific
elements in your prompt.</p>
<h4 id="example-prompt">Example Prompt</h4>
<p><code>text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre title="Before" A sunset landscape</code></p>
<p><code>text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre title="After" A vibrant orange and pink sunset over a snow-capped mountain range, with soft, wispy clouds reflecting off a calm lake in the foreground</code></p>
<p>The revised prompt provides specific details about the colours,
textures, and elements in the scene, ensuring FLUX.1 generates a more
accurate and visually appealing image.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-language">Dynamic Language</h3>
<p>Dynamic and Active Language. Creating Movement and Engagement.</p>
<p>Using dynamic and active language in your prompts can make your
images feel more alive and engaging. Instead of describing static
scenes, you can describe actions and movements.</p>
<p>Active language helps FLUX.1 create images that feel dynamic and full
of energy.</p>
<p>Use verbs and action-oriented descriptions to bring your scenes to
life.</p>
<h4 id="example-prompt-1">Example Prompt</h4>
<p><code>text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre title="Before" A mountain peak</code></p>
<p><code>text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre title="After" A majestic mountain peak emerging through swirling morning mist, with golden sunrise light catching the crystalline ice formations</code></p>
<p>The revised prompt uses active language to create a sense of movement
and drama in the image.</p>
<h3 id="use-artistic-references">Use Artistic References</h3>
<p>Referencing specific artists, art movements, or styles can help guide
FLUX.1’s output.</p>
<h4 id="example-prompt-2">Example Prompt</h4>
<pre class="text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre"><code>Create an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh’s “Starry Night,” but replace the village with a futuristic cityscape. Maintain the swirling, expressive brushstrokes and vibrant colour palette of the original, emphasising deep blues and bright yellows. The city should have tall, glowing skyscrapers that blend seamlessly with the swirling sky.</code></pre>
<h3 id="blend-concepts">Blend Concepts</h3>
<p>FLUX.1 excels at combining diverse ideas and themes to create
distinctive images. Combine multiple artistic styles to create unique
visual experiences.</p>
<h4 id="example-prompt-3">Example Prompt</h4>
<pre class="text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre"><code>Illustrate “The Last Supper” by Leonardo da Vinci, but reimagine it with robots in a futuristic setting. Maintain the composition and dramatic lighting of the original painting, but replace the apostles with various types of androids and cyborgs. The table should be a long, sleek metal surface with holographic displays. In place of bread and wine, have the robots interfacing with glowing data streams.</code></pre>
<h4 id="example-prompt-4">Example Prompt</h4>
<pre class="text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre"><code>Create an image that fuses the precision of M.C. Escher’s impossible geometries with the bold colours and shapes of Wassily Kandinsky’s abstract compositions. The subject should be a surreal cityscape where buildings seamlessly transform into musical instruments. Use Escher’s techniques to create paradoxical perspectives and interconnected structures, but render them in Kandinsky’s vibrant, non-representational style. Incorporate musical notations and abstract shapes that flow through the scene, connecting the architectural elements seamlessly. The colour palette should be rich and varied, with particular emphasis on deep blues, vibrant reds, and golden yellows.</code></pre>
<h3 id="temporal-narratives">Temporal Narratives</h3>
<p>Challenge FLUX.1 to convey a sense of time passing or a story
unfolding within a single image.</p>
<h4 id="example-prompt-5">Example Prompt</h4>
<pre class="text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre"><code>Illustrate the life cycle of a monarch butterfly in a single, continuous image. Divide the canvas into four seamlessly blending sections, each representing a stage of the butterfly’s life.

Start on the left with a milkweed plant where tiny eggs are visible on the underside of a leaf. As we move right, show the caterpillar stage with the larva feeding on milkweed leaves. In the third section, depict the chrysalis stage, with the green and gold-flecked pupa hanging from a branch.

Finally, on the right side, show the fully formed adult butterfly emerging, with its wings gradually opening to reveal the iconic orange and black pattern. Use a soft, natural colour palette dominated by greens and oranges. The background should subtly shift from spring to summer as we move from left to right, with changing foliage and lighting to indicate the passage of time.</code></pre>
<h3 id="emotional-gradients">Emotional Gradients</h3>
<p>Direct FLUX.1 to create images that convey a progression of emotions
or moods.</p>
<h4 id="example-prompt-6">Example Prompt</h4>
<pre class="text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre"><code>Create a panoramic image that depicts the progression of a person’s emotional journey from despair to hope. The scene should be a long, winding road that starts in a dark, stormy landscape and gradually transitions to a bright, sunlit meadow.

On the left, begin with a lone figure hunched against the wind, surrounded by bare, twisted trees and ominous storm clouds. As we move right, we see the gradual clearing of the sky, with the road passing through a misty forest where hints of light begin to break through.

Continue the transition with the forest opening up to reveal distant mountains and a rainbow. The figure should become more upright and purposeful in its stride. Finally, on the far right, show the person standing tall in a sunlit meadow full of wildflowers, arms outstretched in a gesture of triumph or liberation.

Use colour and lighting to enhance the emotional journey: start with a dark, desaturated palette on the left, gradually introducing more colour and brightness as we move right, ending in a vibrant, warm colour scheme. The overall composition should create a powerful visual metaphor for overcoming adversity and finding hope.</code></pre>
<h3 id="use-contrast-and-juxtaposition">Use Contrast and
Juxtaposition</h3>
<p>Creating contrast within your prompt can lead to visually striking
and thought-provoking images.</p>
<h4 id="example-prompt-7">Example Prompt</h4>
<pre class="text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre"><code>Create an image that juxtaposes the delicate beauty of nature with the harsh reality of urban decay. Show a vibrant cherry blossom tree in full bloom growing out of a cracked concrete sidewalk in a dilapidated city alley. The tree should be the focal point, with its pink petals contrasting against the grey, graffiti-covered walls of surrounding buildings. Include a small bird perched on one of the branches to emphasise the theme of resilience.</code></pre>
<h3 id="incorporate-mood-and-atmosphere">Incorporate Mood and
Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Describing the emotional tone or atmosphere can help FLUX.1 generate
images with the desired feel.</p>
<h4 id="example-prompt-8">Example Prompt</h4>
<pre class="text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre"><code>Depict a cozy, warmly lit bookstore cafe on a rainy evening. The atmosphere should be inviting and nostalgic, with soft yellow lighting from vintage lamps illuminating rows of well-worn books. Show patrons reading in comfortable armchairs, steam rising from their coffee cups. The large front window should reveal a glistening wet street outside, with blurred lights from passing cars. Emphasise the contrast between the warm interior and the cool, rainy exterior.</code></pre>
<h3 id="unusual-perspectives">Unusual Perspectives</h3>
<p>Challenging FLUX.1 with unique viewpoints can result in visually
interesting images.</p>
<h4 id="example-prompt-9">Example Prompt</h4>
<pre class="text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre"><code>Illustrate a “bug’s-eye view” of a picnic in a lush garden. The perspective should be from ground level, looking up at towering blades of grass and wildflowers that frame the scene. In the distance, show the underside of a red and white checkered picnic blanket with the silhouettes of picnic foods and human figures visible through the semi-transparent fabric. Include a few ants in the foreground carrying crumbs, and a ladybug climbing a blade of grass. The lighting should be warm and dappled, as if filtering through leaves.</code></pre>
<h2 id="hierarchical-structure">Hierarchical Structure</h2>
<h3 id="layered-compositions-and-clear-placement">Layered Compositions
and Clear Placement</h3>
<p>FLUX.1 allows you to define the placement of objects in different
layers: foreground, middle ground, and background. This helps create
depth and complexity in your images.</p>
<p>Layered compositions make images more dynamic and visually
interesting. Precise placement ensures that FLUX.1 positions elements
correctly, avoiding cluttered or unbalanced compositions.</p>
<p>Organise your prompt hierarchically, specifying where each element
should appear (e.g., foreground, middle ground, background).</p>
<h4 id="example-prompt-10">Example Prompt</h4>
<p><code>text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre title="Before" A terrarium with plants and a neon sign</code></p>
<p><code>text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre title="After" A hanging glass terrarium featuring a miniature rainforest scene with colourful orchids and tiny waterfalls (foreground). Just beyond the glass, a neon sign reads ‘Rainforest Retreat’ in bright green and yellow letters (middle ground). The rain-soaked glass creates a beautiful distortion, adding a soft glow to the sign's vibrant colours (background).</code></p>
<p>The revised prompt clearly defines the placement of each element,
creating a layered and visually rich composition.</p>
<h2 id="contrasting-colors-and-aesthetics">Contrasting Colors and
Aesthetics</h2>
<h3 id="using-contrasts-for-visual-impact">Using Contrasts for Visual
Impact</h3>
<p>Contrasting colours and aesthetics can make your images more striking
and memorable. For example, you can create a scene where one side is
bright and cheerful, while the other is dark and moody.</p>
<p>Contrasts draw the viewer’s attention and add depth to your images,
making them more engaging.</p>
<p>Describe the contrasting elements clearly and specify how they
interact (e.g., sharp transition or soft blending).</p>
<h4 id="example-prompt-11">Example Prompt</h4>
<p><code>text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre title="Before" A tree in a field</code></p>
<p><code>text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre title="After" A single tree stands in the middle of the image. The left half of the tree features bright, vibrant green leaves under a sunny blue sky, while the right half has bare branches covered in frost, set against a cold, dark, and thunderous sky. On the left, there's lush green grass; on the right, thick snow. The split is sharp, with the transition happening right down the middle of the tree.</code></p>
<p>The revised prompt uses contrasting colours and aesthetics to create
a visually striking image.</p>
<h3 id="describing-transitions">Describing Transitions</h3>
<p>When using contrasting elements, you can control how they transition
from one to the other. The transition can be sharp and abrupt or soft
and blended.</p>
<p>The type of transition affects the mood and visual flow of the
image.</p>
<p>Specify whether the transition should be sharp or blended, and
describe how the elements interact at the boundary.</p>
<h4 id="example-prompt-12">Example Prompt</h4>
<p><code>text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre title="Before" A landscape with a sunny side and a rainy side</code></p>
<p><code>text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre title="After" A landscape where the left side is sunny and bright, with golden fields and a clear blue sky, while the right side is rainy and dark, with storm clouds and wet grass. The transition between the two sides is soft and blended, creating a dreamy effect.</code></p>
<p>The revised prompt describes a soft transition between contrasting
elements, adding a dreamy quality to the image.</p>
<h2 id="see-through-materials-and-textures">See-Through Materials and
Textures</h2>
<h3 id="transparent-materials">Transparent Materials</h3>
<p>FLUX.1 can create images with transparent materials, such as glass,
ice, or plastic. These materials add depth and realism to your
images.</p>
<p>Transparent materials allow you to create complex compositions where
objects or text are visible through other elements.</p>
<p>Clearly describe the transparent material and what is visible behind
it.</p>
<h4 id="example-prompt-13">Example Prompt</h4>
<p><code>text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre title="Before" A neon sign in a room</code></p>
<p><code>text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre title="After" A neon sign reading ‘Rainforest Retreat’ is visible through a rain-soaked glass window. The glass creates a beautiful distortion, adding a soft glow to the sign's vibrant colours.</code></p>
<p>The revised prompt uses a transparent material (glass) to create a
visually interesting effect.</p>
<h3 id="textures-and-reflections">Textures and Reflections</h3>
<p>Textures and reflections can add realism and depth to your images,
enhancing their visual appeal. For example, you can describe how light
reflects off a glass surface or how textures like frost or water
droplets appear.</p>
<p>Textures and reflections make your images more lifelike and
engaging.</p>
<p>Describe the texture or reflection in detail, including how it
interacts with light and other elements in the scene.</p>
<h4 id="example-prompt-14">Example Prompt</h4>
<p><code>text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre title="Before" A glass of water</code></p>
<p><code>text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre title="After" A glass of water on a wooden table, with light reflecting off the surface of the glass. The glass is covered in tiny water droplets, and the table has a rough, textured finish.</code></p>
<p>The revised prompt adds textures and reflections to create a more
realistic image.</p>
<h2 id="technical-parameters">Technical Parameters</h2>
<p><strong>Note on Technical Parameters</strong></p>
<p>This section explores advanced techniques for enhancing realism and
control in your images. However, keep in mind that the effectiveness of
these parameters (e.g., camera devices, lenses, settings) can vary
depending on the FLUX model you’re using, as well as other factors like
LoRAs and training data. These tips are highly experimental, so feel
free to adjust or omit them based on your specific needs and the model’s
behaviour.</p>
<h3 id="camera-devices">Camera Devices</h3>
<p>Different cameras produce different looks and feels in images. For

<h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
<p>Camera settings like aperture, ISO, and shutter speed control how
light is captured, affecting the image’s brightness, focus, and
motion.</p>
<h4 id="aperture-f-stop">Aperture (f-stop)</h4>
<p>Controls how much light enters the camera and how much of the image
is in focus. A low f-stop (e.g., f/2.8) creates a blurred background,
while a high f-stop (e.g., f/16) keeps everything sharp.</p>
<h4 id="iso">ISO</h4>
<p>Controls the camera’s sensitivity to light. Low ISO (e.g., 100) is
best for bright scenes, while high ISO (e.g., 1600) is used in low-light
conditions but can add grain or noise.</p>
<h4 id="shutter-speed">Shutter Speed</h4>
<p>Controls how long the camera’s shutter stays open. Fast shutter
speeds (e.g., 1/1000s) freeze motion, while slow shutter speeds (e.g.,
30s) create motion blur or light trails.</p>
<p>These settings help FLUX.1 mimic real-world photography techniques,
adding realism to your images.</p>
<p>Use settings to achieve specific effects. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use “<strong><em>low f-stop</em></strong>” for a blurred background
in portraits.</li>
<li>Use “<strong><em>high ISO</em></strong>” for low-light scenes like
night cityscapes.</li>
<li>Use “<strong><em>slow shutter speed</em></strong>” to capture motion
blur or light trails.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="example-prompt-17">Example Prompt</h4>
<p><strong>Settings</strong></p>

<h2 id="advanced-techniques">Advanced Techniques</h2>
<p>For complex scenes, consider breaking down your prompt into layers,
focusing on different elements of the image.</p>
<h4 id="example-prompt-23">Example Prompt</h4>
<pre class="text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre"><code>Create a bustling marketplace in a fantastical floating city.

Layer 1 (Background): Depict a city of interconnected floating islands suspended in a pastel sky. The islands should have a mix of whimsical architectural styles, from towering spires to quaint cottages. Show distant airships and flying creatures in the background.

Layer 2 (Middle ground): Focus on the main marketplace area. Illustrate a vast plaza with colourful stalls and shops selling exotic goods. Include floating platforms that serve as walkways between different sections of the market.

Layer 3 (Foreground): Populate the scene with a diverse array of fantasy creatures and humanoids. Show vendors calling out to customers, children chasing magical floating bubbles, and a street performer juggling balls of light. In the immediate foreground, depict a detailed stall selling glowing potions and mystical artifacts.

Atmosphere: The overall mood should be vibrant and magical, with soft, ethereal lighting that emphasises the fantastical nature of the scene.</code></pre>

<h3 id="incorrect-syntax">Incorrect Syntax</h3>
<p>Avoid using syntax from other AI tools (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
FLUX.1 has its quirks and preferences. For example, “colourful garden
(with a single rose)++” would mean the user wants to emphasise the “with
a single rose” part of the prompt.</p>
<p>Using incorrect syntax can confuse FLUX.1 and lead to unexpected
results.</p>
<p>Stick to FLUX.1’s preferred syntax and avoid importing syntax from
other tools. Use phrases such as “with emphasis on” or “with a focus on”
in your prompt to guide the AI in the right direction.</p>
<h4 id="example-prompt-24">Example Prompt</h4>
<p><code>text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre title="Before" (best quality, ultra-detailed)</code></p>
<p><code>text:no-line-numbers:no-v-pre title="After" Highly detailed and vibrant</code></p>
<p>The revised prompt uses FLUX.1’s preferred syntax, ensuring clarity
and accuracy.</p>
<h3 id="overcomplicating-prompts">Overcomplicating Prompts</h3>

<p>The revised prompt is concise and focused, ensuring FLUX.1 generates
a clear and visually appealing image.</p>
<h3 id="white-background-in-dev">“White background” in [dev]</h3>
<p>Are you getting fuzzy outputs from FLUX.1? If your prompt has a
“white background,” it might be to blame. It’s worth noting that this
issue only affects the [<strong>dev</strong>] variant; it doesn’t occur
in [<strong>schnell</strong>].</p>
<p>https://getimg.ai/blog/flux-1-generating-blurry-images-heres-how-to-fix-it</p>
<p>Do not use the “white background” phrase in your prompt.</p>
