### Part 5: Advanced Techniques and Problem Solving

_40 minutes_

#### Complex Scene Construction

**Multi-Element Coordination**

-   **Layered Descriptions**: Build scenes with foreground, midground, background
-   **Character Interaction**: Multiple subjects with clear relationships
-   **Environmental Storytelling**: Objects and settings that tell a story

**Example - Complex Scene Prompt**:

```
Cinematic establishing shot of a bustling 1940s New York newsroom, multiple journalists at typewriters in the foreground, editor reviewing papers at desk in midground, large windows showing city skyline in background, warm tungsten lighting creating dramatic shadows, film noir atmosphere, shot with 24mm lens from elevated angle, high contrast black and white photography with selective color on red telephone, documentary realism style
```

#### Advanced Problem-Solving Techniques

##### When Prompts Don't Work

1. **Decomposition Strategy**: Break complex prompts into simpler parts
2. **Priority Hierarchy**: Identify most important elements first
3. **Alternative Phrasing**: Try different ways to describe the same concept
4. **Reference Integration**: Use "in the style of [specific reference]"

##### Common Advanced Challenges

**Challenge 1: Conflicting Style Elements**

-   **Problem**: Mixing incompatible styles (realistic + cartoon)
-   **Solution**: Choose dominant style, use modifiers like "subtle" or "hint of"
-   **Example**: "Photorealistic portrait with subtle anime-inspired features"

**Challenge 2: Complex Lighting Scenarios**

-   **Problem**: Multiple light sources causing confusion
-   **Solution**: Specify primary and secondary lighting separately
-   **Example**: "Primary: soft window light from left, secondary: warm fireplace glow"

**Challenge 3: Precise Color Control**

-   **Problem**: Getting exact colors consistently
-   **Solution**: Use specific color names, hex codes, or reference materials
-   **Example**: "Tiffany blue (#0ABAB5) dress", "Pantone Red 186"

**Challenge 4: Anatomical Accuracy**

-   **Problem**: Incorrect body proportions or poses
-   **Solution**: Use anatomical references and clear pose descriptions
-   **Example**: "Anatomically correct proportions, classical contrapposto pose"

#### Professional Quality Control

##### Quality Assessment Criteria

1. **Technical Quality**: Resolution, sharpness, noise levels
2. **Artistic Merit**: Composition, color harmony, visual impact
3. **Prompt Adherence**: How well the image matches the description
4. **Professional Standards**: Suitable for intended use case

##### Iteration Strategies

-   **Systematic Variation**: Change one element at a time
-   **Comparative Generation**: Multiple versions with slight differences
-   **Progressive Refinement**: Gradual improvement through iterations
-   **A/B Testing**: Compare different approaches directly
