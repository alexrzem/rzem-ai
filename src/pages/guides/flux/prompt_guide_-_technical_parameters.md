# Technical Parameters

**Note on Technical Parameters**

This section explores advanced techniques for enhancing realism and control in your images. However, keep in mind that the effectiveness of these parameters (e.g., camera devices, lenses, settings) can vary depending on the FLUX model you’re using, as well as other factors like LoRAs and training data. These tips are highly experimental, so feel free to adjust or omit them based on your specific needs and the model’s behavior.

## Camera Devices

### What it means
Different cameras produce different looks and feels in images. For example, a smartphone camera might give a casual, everyday vibe, while a professional DSLR camera can create sharp, high-quality images.

### Why it matters
Specifying a camera helps FLUX.1 mimic the style and quality of real-world photography.

### Common Cameras and Their Uses

| Camera | Best for | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| iPhone (e.g., iPhone 15) | Casual, modern, and everyday shots. | *Social media posts, relatable scenes, or casual portraits* |
| Canon EOS R5 | Professional, high-detail images with vibrant colors and sharp focus. | *Landscapes, portraits, or high-quality product shots* |
| Sony Alpha 7R IV | High-resolution images with rich textures and fine details. | *Nature photography, architecture, or detailed close-ups* |
| Polaroid Instant Camera | Vintage, nostalgic shots with soft colors and slight imperfections. | *Retro or artistic scenes* |

### Example Prompt

**Camera**

```
Canon EOS R5
```

**Prompt**

```
A vibrant orange and pink sunset over a snow-capped mountain range, shot on a Canon EOS R5, capturing the vibrant colors and sharp details of the scene.
```

## Lenses

### What it means
Lenses control how much of the scene is visible (field of view) and how much of the image is in focus (depth of field). Different lenses are suited for different types of shots.

### Common Lenses and Their Uses

| Lense | Length | Best for |
|--------|----------|------|
| Wide-Angle Lens | 16-35mm | Capturing a broad view, perfect for landscapes, cityscapes, or large interiors. |
| Standard Lens | 50mm | Everyday shots, portraits, and scenes where you want a natural perspective. It also creates a nice blurred background (bokeh). |
| Telephoto Lens | 70-200mm | Zooming in on distant subjects, ideal for close-ups, wildlife, or isolating a subject from the background. |
| Macro Lens | 100mm | Extreme close-ups, perfect for capturing small details like insects, flowers, or textures. |

### Example Prompt

**Lens**

```
50mm Standard Lens
```

**Prompt**

```
A portrait shot with a 50mm lens, capturing the subject’s face in sharp focus with a softly blurred background.
```

## Settings

### What it means
Camera settings like aperture, ISO, and shutter speed control how light is captured, affecting the image’s brightness, focus, and motion.

### Aperture (f-stop)
Controls how much light enters the camera and how much of the image is in focus. A low f-stop (e.g., f/2.8) creates a blurred background, while a high f-stop (e.g., f/16) keeps everything sharp.

### ISO
Controls the camera’s sensitivity to light. Low ISO (e.g., 100) is best for bright scenes, while high ISO (e.g., 1600) is used in low-light conditions but can add grain or noise.

### Shutter Speed
Controls how long the camera’s shutter stays open. Fast shutter speeds (e.g., 1/1000s) freeze motion, while slow shutter speeds (e.g., 30s) create motion blur or light trails.

### Why it matters
These settings help FLUX.1 mimic real-world photography techniques, adding realism to your images.

### How to apply it
Use settings to achieve specific effects. For example:

* Use "***low f-stop***" for a blurred background in portraits.
* Use "***high ISO***" for low-light scenes like night cityscapes.
* Use "***slow shutter speed***" to capture motion blur or light trails.

### Example Prompt

**Settings**

```
f/8, ISO 100, 30-second shutter speed
```

**Prompt**

```
A night cityscape with skyscrapers, neon signs, and car light trails, shot with f/8, ISO 100, and a 30-second shutter speed, capturing the city lights with sharp details and minimal noise.
```

## Shot Types

### What it means
The type of shot determines how the scene is framed and what elements are emphasized.

* Wide-angle shots capture a broad view, perfect for landscapes or large scenes.
* Medium shots focus on a specific area, ideal for portraits or detailed scenes.
* Close-up shots zoom in on a subject, highlighting details like textures or expressions.

### Why it matters
The shot type affects the composition and focus of your image, guiding the viewer’s attention.

### How to apply it
Specify the shot type to frame your image correctly.

For example:
* Use "wide-angle shot" for expansive landscapes.
* Use "close-up shot" for detailed textures or small objects.

### Example Prompt

**Shot Type**

```
Wide-angle shot
```

**Prompt**

```
A wide-angle shot of a mountain range at sunrise, capturing the expansive landscape with vibrant colors and sharp details.
```
