# Hierarchical Structure

## Layered Compositions and Clear Placement

### What it means
FLUX.1 allows you to define the placement of objects in different layers: foreground, middle ground, and background. This helps create depth and complexity in your images.

### Why it matters
Layered compositions make images more dynamic and visually interesting. Clear placement ensures that FLUX.1 positions elements correctly, avoiding cluttered or unbalanced compositions.

### How to apply it
Organize your prompt hierarchically, specifying where each element should appear (e.g., foreground, middle ground, background).

### Example Prompt

***Before***

```
A terrarium with plants and a neon sign.
```

***After***

```
A hanging glass terrarium featuring a miniature rainforest scene with colorful orchids and tiny waterfalls (foreground). Just beyond the glass, a neon sign reads ‘Rainforest Retreat’ in bright green and yellow letters (middle ground). The rain-soaked glass creates a beautiful distortion, adding a soft glow to the sign's vibrant colors (background).
```

### Explanation
The revised prompt clearly defines the placement of each element, creating a layered and visually rich composition.
