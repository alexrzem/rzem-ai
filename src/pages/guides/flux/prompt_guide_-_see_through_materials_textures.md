# See-Through Materials and Textures

## Transparent Materials

### What it means
FLUX.1 can create images with transparent materials like glass, ice, or plastic. These materials add depth and realism to your images.

### Why it matters
Transparent materials allow you to create complex compositions where objects or text are visible through other elements.

### How to apply it
Clearly describe the transparent material and what is visible behind it.

### Example Prompt

***Before***

```
A neon sign in a room.
```

***After***

```
A neon sign reading ‘Rainforest Retreat’ visible through a rain-soaked glass window. The glass creates a beautiful distortion, adding a soft glow to the sign's vibrant colors.
```

### Explanation
The revised prompt uses a transparent material (glass) to create a visually interesting effect.

## Textures and Reflections

### What it means
Textures and reflections can add realism and depth to your images. For example, you can describe how light reflects off a glass surface or how textures like frost or water droplets appear.

### Why it matters
Textures and reflections make your images more lifelike and engaging.

### How to apply it
Describe the texture or reflection in detail, including how it interacts with light and other elements in the scene.

### Example Prompt

***Before***

```
A glass of water.
```

***After***

```
A glass of water on a wooden table, with light reflecting off the surface of the glass. The glass is covered in tiny water droplets, and the table has a rough, textured finish.
```

### Explanation
The revised prompt adds textures and reflections to create a more realistic image.
