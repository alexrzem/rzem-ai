# Descriptive Language

## Precision and Clarity

### What it means

FLUX.1 responds best to precise and clear language. Vague terms like "*nice*" or "*beautiful*" can lead to ambiguous results. Instead, use specific descriptors that clearly define the image you want to create.

### Why it matters
Precision helps FLUX.1 understand your intent, reducing the likelihood of unexpected or off-target results.

### How to apply it
Focus on details like colors, textures, styles, and specific elements in your prompt.

### Example Prompt

***Before***

```
A sunset landscape.
```

***After***

```
A vibrant orange and pink sunset over a snow-capped mountain range, with soft, wispy clouds reflecting off a calm lake in the foreground.
```

### Explanation
The revised prompt provides specific details about the colors, textures, and elements in the scene, ensuring FLUX.1 generates a more accurate and visually appealing image.

## Dynamic and Active Language (Creating Movement and Engagement)

### What it means
Using dynamic and active language in your prompts can make your images feel more alive and engaging. Instead of describing static scenes, you can describe actions and movements.

### Why it matters
Active language helps FLUX.1 create images that feel dynamic and full of energy.

### How to apply it
Use verbs and action-oriented descriptions to bring your scenes to life.

### Example Prompt

***Before***

```
A mountain peak.
```

***After***

```
A majestic mountain peak emerging through swirling morning mist, with golden sunrise light catching the crystalline ice formations.
```

### Explanation
The revised prompt uses active language to create a sense of movement and drama in the image.

## Use Artistic References

### What it means
Referencing specific artists, art movements, or styles can help guide FLUX.1’s output.

### Why it matters

### How to apply it

### Example Prompt

```
Create an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh’s “Starry Night,” but replace the village with a futuristic cityscape. Maintain the swirling, expressive brushstrokes and vibrant color palette of the original, emphasizing deep blues and bright yellows. The city should have tall, glowing skyscrapers that blend seamlessly with the swirling sky.
```

## Blend Concepts

### What it means
FLUX.1 excels at combining different ideas or themes to create unique images. Combine multiple artistic styles to create unique visual experiences.

### Why it matters

### How to apply it

### Example Prompt

```
Illustrate “The Last Supper” by Leonardo da Vinci, but reimagine it with robots in a futuristic setting. Maintain the composition and dramatic lighting of the original painting, but replace the apostles with various types of androids and cyborgs. The table should be a long, sleek metal surface with holographic displays. In place of bread and wine, have the robots interfacing with glowing data streams.
```

### Example Prompt

```
Create an image that fuses the precision of M.C. Escher’s impossible geometries with the bold colors and shapes of Wassily Kandinsky’s abstract compositions. The subject should be a surreal cityscape where buildings seamlessly transform into musical instruments. Use Escher’s techniques to create paradoxical perspectives and interconnected structures, but render them in Kandinsky’s vibrant, non-representational style. Incorporate musical notations and abstract shapes that flow through the scene, connecting the architectural elements. The color palette should be rich and varied, with particular emphasis on deep blues, vibrant reds, and golden yellows.
```

## Temporal Narratives

### What it means
Challenge FLUX.1 to convey a sense of time passing or a story unfolding within a single image.

### Why it matters

### How to apply it

### Example Prompt

```
Illustrate the life cycle of a monarch butterfly in a single, continuous image. Divide the canvas into four seamlessly blending sections, each representing a stage of the butterfly’s life.

Start on the left with a milkweed plant where tiny eggs are visible on the underside of a leaf. As we move right, show the caterpillar stage with the larva feeding on milkweed leaves. In the third section, depict the chrysalis stage, with the green and gold-flecked pupa hanging from a branch.

Finally, on the right side, show the fully formed adult butterfly emerging, with its wings gradually opening to reveal the iconic orange and black pattern. Use a soft, natural color palette dominated by greens and oranges. The background should subtly shift from spring to summer as we move from left to right, with changing foliage and lighting to indicate the passage of time.
```

## Emotional Gradients

### What it means
Direct FLUX.1 to create images that convey a progression of emotions or moods.

### Why it matters

### How to apply it

### Example Prompt

```
Create a panoramic image that depicts the progression of a person’s emotional journey from despair to hope. The scene should be a long, winding road that starts in a dark, stormy landscape and gradually transitions to a bright, sunlit meadow.

On the left, begin with a lone figure hunched against the wind, surrounded by bare, twisted trees and ominous storm clouds. As we move right, show the gradual clearing of the sky, with the road passing through a misty forest where hints of light begin to break through.

Continue the transition with the forest opening up to reveal distant mountains and a rainbow. The figure should become more upright and purposeful in their stride. Finally, on the far right, show the person standing tall in a sunlit meadow full of wildflowers, arms outstretched in a gesture of triumph or liberation.

Use color and lighting to enhance the emotional journey: start with a dark, desaturated palette on the left, gradually introducing more color and brightness as we move right, ending in a vibrant, warm color scheme. The overall composition should create a powerful visual metaphor for overcoming adversity and finding hope.
```

## Use Contrast and Juxtaposition

### What it means
Creating contrast within your prompt can lead to visually striking and thought-provoking images.

### Why it matters

### How to apply it

### Example Prompt

```
Create an image that juxtaposes the delicate beauty of nature with the harsh reality of urban decay. Show a vibrant cherry blossom tree in full bloom growing out of a cracked concrete sidewalk in a dilapidated city alley. The tree should be the focal point, with its pink petals contrasting against the gray, graffiti-covered walls of surrounding buildings. Include a small bird perched on one of the branches to emphasize the theme of resilience.
```

## Incorporate Mood and Atmosphere

### What it means
Describing the emotional tone or atmosphere can help FLUX.1 generate images with the desired feel.

### Why it matters

### How to apply it

### Example Prompt

```
Depict a cozy, warmly lit bookstore cafe on a rainy evening. The atmosphere should be inviting and nostalgic, with soft yellow lighting from vintage lamps illuminating rows of well-worn books. Show patrons reading in comfortable armchairs, steam rising from their coffee cups. The large front window should reveal a glistening wet street outside, with blurred lights from passing cars. Emphasize the contrast between the warm interior and the cool, rainy exterior.
```

## Unusual Perspectives

### What it means
Challenging FLUX.1 with unique viewpoints can result in visually interesting images.

### Why it matters

### How to apply it

### Example Prompt

```
Illustrate a “bug’s-eye view” of a picnic in a lush garden. The perspective should be from ground level, looking up at towering blades of grass and wildflowers that frame the scene. In the distance, show the underside of a red and white checkered picnic blanket with the silhouettes of picnic foods and human figures visible through the semi-transparent fabric. Include a few ants in the foreground carrying crumbs, and a ladybug climbing a blade of grass. The lighting should be warm and dappled, as if filtering through leaves.
```
