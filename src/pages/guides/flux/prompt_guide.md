# Introduction
This manual is designed to help you get the most out of FLUX.1, an AI tool for generating high-quality images. Whether you're new to AI image generation or have some experience, this guide will walk you through the basics of crafting effective prompts. You’ll learn how to create images that are visually stunning, detailed, and aligned with your vision.

The manual is divided into key sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of prompt creation. It includes clear explanations, practical examples, and tips to help you avoid common mistakes. While this guide covers the essentials, remember that FLUX.1 is a versatile tool, and experimentation is key to mastering it. Let’s dive in and start creating!

Note on Model Variability:

FLUX.1 is a versatile tool, but it’s important to remember that different FLUX models (e.g., FLUX.1 **[pro]**, **[dev]**, **[schnell]**) may produce varying results from the same prompt. Additionally, factors like LoRAs (Low-Rank Adaptations) and other variables can influence the output. Experimentation is key to understanding how your chosen model interprets prompts, so don’t be afraid to tweak and refine your approach based on the results you get.

## FLUX.1 Variants
FLUX.1 is available in three main variants:

1. **FLUX.1 [pro]**: The flagship model, offering state-of-the-art performance in image generation. It excels in prompt following, visual quality, image detail, and output diversity. This version is ideal for professional use and high-end applications.
2. **FLUX.1 [dev]**: An open-weight, guidance-distilled model designed for non-commercial applications. It offers similar quality to the Pro version but with improved efficiency, making it suitable for developers and researchers.
3. **FLUX.1 [schnell]**: The fastest model in the suite, optimized for local development and personal use. It’s openly available under an Apache 2.0 license, making it accessible for a wide range of users.

## FLUX.1 [dev] Configuration Settings

While a well-crafted prompt is essential, optimizing **FLUX.1 [dev]**’s settings is equally important to achieving high-quality results. 

Here's a breakdown of key configuration parameters:

* **Seed Value**: The seed value ensures consistency in generated images. A random, but fixed value can be reused to replicate specific outputs. In this guide, we use a seed value of 42.
* **Image Dimensions**: Set dimensions, such as **1024**x**1024** pixels, for balanced image quality and file size.
* **Guidance Scale**: A guidance scale of **3.5** strikes a balance between creativity and the adherence to prompt specificity.
* **Inference Steps**: Setting **50** inference steps ensures detailed images, with the model given enough iterations to fine-tune the visual output.
* **Number of Images**: Start with a single image generation (Num Images = 1) to iterate efficiently.

These settings allow **FLUX.1 [dev]** to maintain focus on your prompt’s specific elements while also delivering creative outputs.
